Blackjack is a game where the player(s) attempt to beat the dealer by getting as close to 21 points as they can without going over. 

Aces count as either 11 or 1, depending on if it takes you over 21 or not.

Jacks, queens, and kings act as 10 points.

The remaining cards act as their standard value. 

The player can keep drawing cards until they reach/pass 21, or say they don't want to draw another card.
