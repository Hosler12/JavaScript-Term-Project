Go fish is a simple game where you want to get as many sets of four cards of the same value(books) as you can.

The game ends when one player has 7 points, or one player runs out of cards in their hand.

You can get cards one of two ways. The first is you ask the player if they have a certain card based on the options from the drop down. If they do, you receive all of their cards of that value.

If they do not have the card, then you draw a card from the deck.
