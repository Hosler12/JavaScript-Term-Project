This project contains three different games that should be accessed via the main page. 

The first game is blackjack where players will attempt to reach 21 points in a one on one against the dealer.

The second game is go fish, where players will attempt to get sets of four in a one on one against a very simple minded ai.

The third game has the player move around obstacles to get as far as possible.
