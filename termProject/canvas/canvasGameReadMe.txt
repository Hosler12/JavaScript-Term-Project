The canvas game is the third wheel of this unicycle. 

In this game, you attempt to get as far as you can by dodging the bars that come your way.

You dodge bars by clicking the movement buttons below the game, and you get more points the longer you survive.

While this game is technically a game, it is a dissapointing one that should have more variance in the future, and potentially the bars will push you back instead of end the game to reward moving forward.

I might also have the colors of the obstacles change over time so the player doesn't need check the score to see how far they are.
